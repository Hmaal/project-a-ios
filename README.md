Project A 
a game by Mike Bell
http://gikh.in

This is early work from my first game, Project A, for iOS. It is a dungeon crawler focused around 
procedurally-generated assets and levels. This isn't the prettiest version, nor will it be the last, so I hope 
people check it out and at least get some good ideas from it.

To build, open the xcode project file in xcode, build, and then run. 

I will be performing a more detailed write up later so that I may detail how people can extend this framework.

Peace out!
