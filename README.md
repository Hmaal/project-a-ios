Project A is a dungeon-crawler built around procedural assets and level-design.<br/>
It is currently in its infancy. <br/>
I did not intend for it to be iOS-exclusive.<br/>
This version has many bugs and needs to be re-worked at the ground up.<br/>
However the funder has pulled funding.<br/>
So I am releasing this version as open-source.<br/>
Future work will be available open-source as well.<br/>
I will update this readme as necessary.<br/>
